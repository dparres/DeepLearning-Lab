# Deep Learning Lab
This repository contains the laboratory sessions that I have conducted for the Artificial Neural Networks subject in the [Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, and Digital Imaging](https://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUIARFID/) at the [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es).

## Sessions

+ Lab1: Multilayer Perceptron on [MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist)

+ Lab2: Convolutional Neural Networks on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Recommendations

Use [Googe Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the experiments in virtual machines equiped with GPUs just in case you don't have a GPU computer to run them.
