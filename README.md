# Deep Learning Lab
This repository contains the laboratory sessions that I have conducted for the Artificial Neural Networks subject in the [Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, and Digital Imaging](https://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUIARFID/) at the Universitat Politècnica de València.

## Sessions

+ Multilayer perceptron on [MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist):

+ Convolutional neural network on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html):

## Recommendations

Use [Googe Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the experiments in virtual machines equiped with GPUs just in case you don't have a GPU computer to run them
